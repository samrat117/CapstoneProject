Proposal 1: Insights into healthcare cost

The cost of healthcare across the US is not same or the level of care provided constant. Patients across the US pay different charges for the same treatment.Data shows significant variation across the country and within communities in what providers charge for common services. The idea here is to compare charges for the 100 most common inpatient services and 30 common outpatient services across states and provide people with a comparative result set.

The data for this project will come from the US data.gov site "https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3".
